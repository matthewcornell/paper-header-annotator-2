# Annotator Demo
## Description
*(This is a fork of a client's source repo where I've rewritten the app in Python, replaced the SVG file repository
with a read-only fake DAO, and edited this README to give an introduction to the project, share technical decisions made,
and briefly describe the code.)*

This is a simple [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)-based web app that demonstrates using
[Fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/) to implement a direct-manipulation SVG annotation tool. It has a bare-bones UI and
layout (i.e., no Bootstrap or equivalent) and no production-level features such as authentication, authorization,
document owners and assignments, error handling, concurrent access, deployment, etc. However, it does support most of
the front end features desired, plus the connection to the back end. The original prototype supported adding new svg
files by dropping them into the repository directory, which a DAO would pick up, creating corresponding json files as
needed. This demo uses a fixed repository of a few files to keep it simple. The point is mainly to show the front end
proof-of-concept using Fabric.js. It is currently live at
[annotator-demo.herokuapp.com](https://annotator-demo.herokuapp.com).

## Motivation
The fuller version of this tool was used to help a group of people annotate thousands of PDF files in SVG format as
generated by Mozilla Labs' [pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js). The SVG retains formatting and so is
browser-renderable, but the markup is more useful for
[information extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_extraction) than that of PDF. The ultimate goal of
the project was to create a gold standard for comparing the IE output to. Along with saving a document's annotations,
users could ask the server for the text bounded by a particular annotation rectangle - a non-trivial problem with these
complex SVG files (the <tspan>'s generated are quite chopped up).

The decision to to write a tool was made after I researched existing annotation tools including some amazing ones:
 
* [Annotator](http://annotatorjs.org/)
* [ZURB JavaScript Annotation Plugin](http://zurb.com/playground/javascript-annotation-plugin)
* [Annotorious](http://annotorious.github.io/)
* [Annotation Studio](http://www.annotationstudio.org/)

Unfortunately they lacked the customization and power user features we needed for the high-throughput workflow
necessary to annotate 1000s of SVG files. I then surveyed JavaScript graphics libraries (both Canvas- and SVG-based) to
find one to support the rectangle-based UI we wanted. I settled on the excellent Fabric.js (the
[demos](http://fabricjs.com/demos/) are awesome) after having looked at general purpose ones (of which there are many)
including:

* [RaphaÃ«l](http://raphaeljs.com/)
* [EaselJS](http://createjs.com/easeljs)
* [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)
* [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/)
* [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/)
* [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/)
* [Snap.svg](http://snapsvg.io/)

I also looked at diagram-oriented libraries, but they felt like too much work compared to a straightforward
[canvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element) wrapper.

* [jsPlumb Toolkit](https://jsplumbtoolkit.com/)
* [WireIt](http://neyric.github.io/wireit/docs/)
* [JointJS - the HTML 5 JavaScript diagramming library.](http://www.jointjs.com/)
* [Draw2D touch: Blog](http://www.draw2d.org/draw2d/)
* [flowchart.js](http://adrai.github.io/flowchart.js/)
* [js-graph.it homepage](http://js-graph-it.sourceforge.net/)
* [Cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org/)

In the end I liked Fabric best for its inbuilt support of handles and grouping, and its solid level of activity. And it
worked pretty well, modulo a number of gotchas. It's a really nice piece of work, as are many of these. The JavaScript
graphics library scene is definitely alive and well.


# Documentation
The UI is a straightforward direct manipulation one where users work with rectangle objects. Click to select, drag
to move, drag resize handles to resize, click the delete rectangle button to remove, etc. The only feature that's non-
obvious is how to add and remove links between rectangles. To add a link, select exactly two rectangles with the same
label and no existing link and then click the add link button. To remove a link, select two rectangles with an existing
link and the click the remove link button. Keystroke shortcuts are supported for power users:

## Keystroke shortcuts
### Types

<pre>
          1: set current type to Title
 shift  + 1: filter all but Title
          2: set current type to Abstract
 shift  + 2: filter all but Abstract
          3: set current type to Author
 shift  + 3: filter all but Author
     Escape: reset filter
</pre>

### Create

<pre>
+: create new annotation using current type
</pre>

### Move & Resize

<pre>
                     arrow key: move selection 1px
            shift  + arrow key: move selection 10px
           option  + arrow key: resize selection 1px
 shift  +  option  + arrow key: resize selection 10px
</pre>

### Delete/Duplicate

<pre>
backspace|delete: delete selection
    control  + d: duplicate selection
</pre>

### Select

<pre>
          tab: select next
 shift  + tab: select previous
</pre>

### Text Feedback

<pre>
x: display text for selection
</pre>

## Routes
At the top level of this standard Flask MVC app is app/routes.py, which has four URIs/controllers:

* `/`: app/templates/index.html template. Lists the SVG files in the fake [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object).
* `/docs/<fileName>`: app/templates/edit.html template. Described below.
* `/docs/<fileName>/annotations`: REST API endpoint for getting a document's annotations as a JSON array. Finds and
   reads the JSON file corresponding to the SVG file and returns it as 'application/json'.
* `/docs/<fileName>/text`: placeholder endpoint for calculating the text bounded by a rectangle. Pulls the rectangle
  bounds from the query parameters and returns a fake string.


## edit.html
This view has a simple vanilla HTML editing section at the top with three hard-coded annotation types, and the editing
area underneath. The latter layers the [Fabric canvas](http://fabricjs.com/docs/fabric.Canvas.html) on top of the SVG
file, whose element is inserted dynamically via `loadSvg()` in app/static/edit-document.js (see below). Finally,
edit.html sets the variables needed by edit-document.js, based on the Flask-injected `fileName` variable, and loads the
Fabric and edit-document.js.


## edit-document.js
This file does the heavy lifting. On load it links up the button and shortcut actions to their methods and then calls
`loadSvg()` to load the SVG document and its annotations. It does so using an AJAX call because of a browser SVG loading
bug where the SVG size is reported incorrectly until it's completely loaded. Once it's loaded, `loadSvg()` inserts the
SVG element behind the Fabric canvas, sets its size, and then initializes the Fabric canvas, saving it as an application
property on the canvas element for easy access. Once that's all done, the function calls `loadAnnotations()`, which
performs the AJAX call to `/docs/<fileName>/annotations` and then creates
[Fabric Rect](http://fabricjs.com/docs/fabric.Rect.html) objects for each, using the correct color for the annotation
type.

One tricky bit was handling the line connecting linked Rects. Lines are managed explicitly (there is no built in
'connector' feature in Fabric), so their endpoints must be dynamically adjust during rectangle moves and resizes, and
pointers to/from them must be saved as properties on the Fabric objects (i.e., a Rect needs to know all of its Lines,
and a Line needs to know its two endpoints' Rects).

The rest of the code manages all the fiddly aspects of the app - resizing, duplicating, linking, etc. And of course
button state must be updated based on selection changes. The only other mildly interesting thing is the AJAX call to get
an annotation rect's text - a straightforward call to the `/docs/<fileName>/text` endpoint.
